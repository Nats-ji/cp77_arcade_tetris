# cp77_arcade_tetris
A mod for Cyberpunk 2077 that lets you play tetris "on" the arcade machines

Download it on Nexus Mods: 

Known issues:
- Prints lots of errors when loading up (Because player is nil for a small time, checking for nil doesnt work in  1.8.3/4)
- Crashes the game when closing it (Also caused by trying to use the player while player is nil)
